# Example_project
Just an example of how I set up a computational/bioinformatics project
## The general structure will be:
### src : (directory) storing/writing source code
### bin :  (directory) storing binary files
### data :  (directory) storing input/raw data files.  Can include metadata files.  All formats loved and supported
### results:  (directory) the good stuff -- proof that I'm doing my work and the work is important
### docs:  (directory) where I keep documentation, because I always document my projects
### README.md: (file) this file.  General overview of what this repository is about
